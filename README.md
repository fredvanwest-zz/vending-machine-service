# vending-machine-service
Vending Machine Service - This service provides a REST interface for retrieving the contents of a vending machine.  In this
initial version, the data is hard coded.  However since the data exists inside data structures, the contents can be 
withdrawn until the in memory data structures are depleted to simulate an empty machine.  The project was built in support
of a blog entry for Unicon.
